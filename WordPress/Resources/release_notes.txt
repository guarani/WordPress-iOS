Our mobile devs were bug-squashing juggernauts this month:
- You should’ve been able to sign into the app with your Apple credentials, but a bug meant that sometimes you couldn’t. That’s fixed now.
- Tweaks make the block editor better and better: links open in-app instead of opening Safari, and a pesky link editing issue that sometimes deleting existing links is no more.
- “Dark Mode” is dark as in “hue” and not as in “grim,” especially now that its got better visuals and fewer bugs.
- Scrolling vertically sometimes didn’t work in the Share extension, and now it does.
